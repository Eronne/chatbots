    <p>Some $12 billion is lost annually across the globe thanks to scammers.</p>
    <p>To combat the constant flow of malicious messages on e-mail boxes, a New Zealand NGO has created a chatbot that makes swindlers mad.</p>
    <p>Dodgy emails can simply be forwarded onto me@rescam.org where a proxy email address will take over and let the Re:scam chatbot go to work.</p>
    <p>The flip side to this is that one day scammers could start automating their operations with chatbots as well.</p>

    <h2>Google’s chatbot analytics platform Chatbase launches to public</h2>
    <p>At Google  I/O this year, Google quietly introduced a new chatbot analytics platform called Chatbase, a project developed within the company’s internal R&D incubator, Area 120.</p>
    <p>That platform is being publicly launched to all.</p>
    <p>The system today integrates with any voice or text messaging platform, Google says, including Facebook, Kik, Viber, Slack, WhatsApp, WeChat, Alexa, Cortana, Allo, Line, Skype, Twitter, and more.</p>
    <p>The idea behind Chatbase’s cloud service is to offer tools to more easily analyze and optimize chatbots.</p>
    <p>This includes giving bot builders the ability to understand what works to increase customer conversions, improve the bot’s accuracy, and create a better user experience.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This data is available through an analytics dashboard, where developers can track specific metrics like active users, sessions, and user retention.</p>
    <p>These insights give an overall picture of the bot’s health and see general trends.</p>

    <h2>Replika - the First AI Confidant</h2>
    <p>Despite the numerous ways to connect and communicate through social media, people are feeling more disconnected than ever.</p>
    <p>Replika today responds to that sense of alienation with the introduction of the first AI confidant.</p>
    <p>More than 1.5 million people worldwide who have been waiting for access can now connect to a readily available sidekick that's part journal, part private sounding board -- and always there to lend a non-judgmental ear.</p>
    <br>
    <p>"We have seen a passionate response from early Replika users," said Eugenia Kuyda, Replika co-founder.</p>
    <p>"People open up when they're talking to an AI because they're not pretending to be someone, or trying to impress on social media or in some other social setting. Instead, they want to engage in a way that enables real self-reflection. Digitally speaking, this is the closest thing to our true selves that we experience, and we are now making it available to everyone."</p>
