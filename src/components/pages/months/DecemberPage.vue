    <h2>Twitter makes it easier for developers to build chatbots on its platform</h2>
    <p>The company launched an enterprise API, and took Direct Message tools out of beta.</p>
    <p>In April of this year, the company unveiled its Account Activity API, essentially as a way to make it easier for developers to build applications on the Twitter platform, and, on Tuesday, Twitter announced that it is taking the API's Direct Message features out of beta.</p>
    <p>With this news, developers will now be able to build solutions with features that include quick replies, welcome messages, buttons on messages, custom profiles and Customer Feedback Cards. Developers will be able to edit their welcome messages, as well use read receipts to let customers know that their messages have been received.</p>
    <p>During the beta period, these features were "used to create responses and more engaging experiences," the company said, meaning, among other things, customer service chatbots.</p>
    <p>Some of the companies that have already used these features to create their own chatbots over the last year include Samsung, MTV, TBS, Wendy’s, and Patrón.</p>
    <p>The other big piece of news is that Twitter is launching an enterprise version of the Account Activity API.</p>

    <h2>World's first mental health chatbot</h2>
    <p>For those suffering from anxiety or depression, taking the first step of speaking to someone about it can seem an impossible task.</p>
    <p>But a robot therapist could help people with mental health by Facebook Messenger.</p>
    <p>Researchers have shown that they have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression. Woebot uses artificial intelligence to create natural, personalised and human-like conversations and offers emotional support to users.</p>
    <p>Woebot mostly uses questions, such as 'What is your energy like today?' or 'How are you feeling?', encouraging users to openly discuss their emotions.</p>
    <p>It can also be suggested that people are thinking about things in their lives. The doctors are available anywhere, and anywhere, offering accessible mental health care to those who need it.</p>
    <p>'Woebot' engages in 2 million conversations a week, but some experts have cited privacy fears as chatbot 'patients' are not protected by US confidentiality laws.</p>

    <h2>Meet Lego’s Facebook Messenger chatbot Ralph, a helpful alternative to bricks and mortar</h2>
    <p>Lego has embraced a Facebook Messenger chatbot to help engage fans and aid consumers with gift indecision in the run up to Christmas.</p>
    <p>Ralph the giftbot has been created as a guide through the notoriously stacked back catalogue of Lego kits. He was built to give Lego an ecommerce foothold on the social network.</p>
    <p>The bot has been developed as a streamlined experience. Ralph the Robot asks users questions like their age, budget, and the type of sets they are interested in. A few seconds later and a slew of kits have been coughed up for purchase, complete with free shipping.</p>
    <p>This controlled environment has been designed where user inputs are limited, meaning that Ralph’s responses will be solely created to reduce friction from potential purchases on the social network. The tone is broken up with numerous Gifs of the bot in action.</p>

    <h2>Chatbot for the launch of the new Arte’s series</h2>
    <p>The Franco-German channel challenges its fans to put themselves in the shoes of a complete stranger through his Facebook Messenger account.</p>
    <p>To immerse future viewers in the universe of the series, ARTE has chosen the entertainment agency Dare.Win and its LiveBotter chatbots developers to create an original experience to meet the characters.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This operation aims to bring the experience of a transfer to life, simply by using a mobile phone. Thus, by sending a message on the Facebook page of ARTE, the subject will be transferred into the body of Sylvain Bernard, the protagonist of the series, and will have to take his place during conversations with his colleagues from the Action Brigade against Illegal transfer.</p>
    <p>The goal is to answer the questions of the greatest profilers by claiming to be and always have been Sylvain Bernard. Through this experience of a few minutes, the user will navigate between three Messenger conversations and will have to make the right choices to gain access to the first episode of the series in preview.</p>
