    <h2>Chatbots: revolution or regression regarding UX design?</h2>
    <p>Will chatbot be deprecated in a near future? That is the question that many people wonder. Indeed, a lot of chatbots are currently not that useful.</p>
    <p>But it’s not all a waste! With the progression of the machine learning, chatbot will become more and more relevant, and they will process our requests faster.</p>
    <p>It can also be a great asset for company, because they allow gathering of analytics in a more “human way”, by talking with a company customer and getting data from their answers.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, they actually needs you to type your question! That’s a waste of time. Event bots of big company like Google (with their Google Assistant) can take some time to process your request and answer your question.</p>
