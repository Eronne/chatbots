    <h2>Is chatbot’s intelligence only artificial ?</h2>
    <p>Did you know that they are around 70% message requests made to chatbot that they do not understand?</p>
    <p>But why is this that difficult for a chatbot to understand our questions?</p>
    <p>We can answer this question by distinguishing 4 major problems of a chatbot:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Lack of robustness</li>
      <li>Limited cover</li>
      <li>Setup cost</li>
      <li>Hard to maintain</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In a near future, we could address those problems by using <strong>Machine Reading</strong>.</p>
    <p>The machine reading is the ability of a bot of understanding the context of a question in his own language, by using complex graph science. It will have a semantic representation of what the used asked, thus increasing his understanding a lot! When it will be ready, it will be a next major step in chatbots history!</p>

    <h2>Chatbot for the launch of the new Arte’s series</h2>
    <p>The Franco-German channel challenges its fans to put themselves in the shoes of a complete stranger through his Facebook Messenger account.</p>
    <p>To immerse future viewers in the universe of the series, ARTE has chosen the entertainment agency Dare.Win and its LiveBotter chatbots developers to create an original experience to meet the characters.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This operation aims to bring the experience of a transfer to life, simply by using a mobile phone. Thus, by sending a message on the Facebook page of ARTE, the subject will be transferred into the body of Sylvain Bernard, the protagonist of the series, and will have to take his place during conversations with his colleagues from the Action Brigade against Illegal transfer.</p>
    <p>The goal is to answer the questions of the greatest profilers by claiming to be and always have been Sylvain Bernard. Through this experience of a few minutes, the user will navigate between three Messenger conversations and will have to make the right choices to gain access to the first episode of the series in preview.</p>

    <h2>How can we all behave like Miranda Priestly ?</h2>
    <p>Who has not dreamed one day, overwhelmed, to be Miranda Priestly, the popess of fashion, with his court of personal assistants in the movie "The Devil Wears Prada"? This is now possible thanks to automated chat robots, in other words chatbots.</p>
    <p class="bold">For your beauty</p>
    <p>Nothing can beat the experience of chatting with a Sephora associate about your makeup needs in person, but the Sephora chatbot on Kik (a popular messaging app) comes pretty close.</p>
    <p>Sephora’s chatbots are helping consumers find deals and make purchases, but also make fashion choices and find products that meet their unique style and tastes. That’s something a simple ecommerce website doesn’t offer.</p>
    <a class="page__source" href="https://bots.kik.com/#/sephora">Try it</a>
    <p class="bold">Clothes</p>
    <p>Clothing brand H&M developed an interactive bot for the Kik messaging app that recommends products based on your own preferences. It starts out by asking you to select photos of clothing that you like. Then it asks you to pick your personal style: Casual, Boho, Preppy, Classic, or Grunge.</p>

    <h2>Chatbot: stop or again?</h2>
    <p>Chatbots are multiplying in companies, who are still groping to test this solution.</p>
    <p>Be careful. Designing a self-learning chatbot and letting it generate text is possible but can be dangerous for a brand. Microsoft has paid the price: he had to muzzle his bot that poured racist remarks influenced by malicious Internet users.</p>
    <p>Another important point: find the relevant location of the bot. Meetic installs it on his website to assist the customer. Direct Energie and Air France prefer to go through Messenger. In any case, companies should never lose sight of the fact that a bot is a tool, not a strategy.</p>
